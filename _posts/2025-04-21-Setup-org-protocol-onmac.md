title: Setting up org-protocol on mac
categories: [Workflow, Emacs]
---
These days, I restarted to use Emacs for some programming as well as workflow with [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/). And I want to do something with [org-protocol](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html) but some settings from the web-site have been out of date. 

So, I followed the instructions in [setup-org-protocol-on-mac](https://github.com/xuchunyang/setup-org-protocol-on-mac) to set the org-protocol on Mac. Then, I spent a lot of time to set the org-protocol bookmark for browser but finally found the javascript should be configured into the format noted in [Firefox and org-protocol URL Capture](https://www.mediaonfire.com/blog_posts/2017_07_21_org_protocol_firefox.html). In this way, I succed to set the org-capture on my Emacs.
