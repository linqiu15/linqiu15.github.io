In this post, I am going to write down some notes on the workflow of the academic writting that facinates me and the post may be updated as time goes by.

# In overleaf
Most researchers work in the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), either within the official website or the local ones hosted on different servers and thus one of the most important ways is how to write in a more convenient environment for which [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good choice.

In VS-code, we can install the [Overleaf-Workshop](https://github.com/iamhyc/Overleaf-Workshop) extension and after logging into the server, we can synchronously edit these files in VS-code and benifit therein.

# Bibliography management
We need to cite when writting academic papers. I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for reference management and to export the bibliography file, I use [better-bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) upon which we can insert the citation in different editors. Take VS-code for an example, we can use [zotero-latex](https://github.com/bnavetta/vscode-zotero-latex) or [zotero-cite](https://gitee.com/rusterx/zotero-cite/blob/master/LICENSE.md) to automatically insert the citation term with evoking keys which can be explained further on their webpages. Unfortunately, I find that the above workflow does not apply when using Overleaf in VS-code possibly because these files are openned in some localhost.
