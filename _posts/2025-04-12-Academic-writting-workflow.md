In this post, I am going to write down some notes on the workflow of the academic writting that facinates me and the post may be updated as time goes by.

# In overleaf
Most researchers work in the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), either within the official website or the local ones hosted on different servers and thus one of the most important ways is how to write in a more convenient environment for which [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good choice.

In VS-code, we can install the [Overleaf-Workshop](https://github.com/iamhyc/Overleaf-Workshop) extension and after logging into the server, we can synchronously edit these files in VS-code and benifit therein.
