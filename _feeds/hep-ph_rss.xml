computations, thereby unifying the treatment of scalars, fermions, and gauge
bosons in effective field theories. This allows us to derive a manifestly
covariant formula for one-loop UV divergences that includes contributions from
mixed boson-fermion graphs. The result is expressed in terms of geometric
invariants of the field-space supermanifold. As a demonstration of this
formula, we compute the renormalization group equations for two-fermion
operators at the dimension-eight level in the Standard Model Effective Field
Theory.

  Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625v2</link><description>  We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the
pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function
(TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using
correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam
function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a =
0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions
in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum
transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper
(CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel
agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$)
between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with
recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in
the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of
the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion
valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm.
Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological
parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable
agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the
transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670
MeV mass.

  Simulation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11888v2</link><description>  Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly
study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive
analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$
expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure
SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is
introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov
subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these
truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at
relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources
required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these
Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.

central objective of present and future Intensity-Frontier experiments.
Interpreting these searches demands a reliable description of ALP production
and decay. The prescription currently adopted by the community depends on
unphysical chiral-rotation parameters, wrongly describes the mass scaling of
the ALP flux, and ignores mixing with heavy pseudoscalar resonances. We
introduce the framework that treats GeV-scale ALP interactions
self-consistently, includes their mixing with heavier excitations $\pi(1300)$,
$\eta(1295)$, $\eta(1440)$, and properly describes production channels. When
applying our description to proton beam experiments, we find that existing
bounds and projected sensitivities shift by up to an order of magnitude
relative to earlier estimates. We further delineate the dominant theoretical
uncertainties, which originate from the still-incomplete experimental knowledge
of the light-meson spectrum.

  modification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18408v1</link><description>  We study the impacts of the squeezing effect caused by in-medium mass
modification on the Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) correlation of $\phi\phi$ using a
hydrodynamical source. The squeezing effect reduces the influence of transverse
flow on the transverse distribution of $\phi$ emitting source while expanding
the longitudinal source distribution. This trend becomes more noticeable as the
transverse momentum increases, resulting in an enlargement of the HBT radii for
$\phi\phi$ . Notably, this enlargement is particularly evident with higher
transverse pair momentum. As a result, the HBT radii of $\phi\phi$ increase as
transverse pair momentum increases instead of showing a consistent crease,
showcasing non-flow behavior of HBT radii in hydrodynamical sources. Both
Gaussian fitting and Levy fitting support the conclusion.

global equilibrium has been examined using a real-time method known as the
virial theorem. We demonstrate these scaling properties through a derived
relation based on the general structure of equal-time commutators among
Poincare charges and their densities. This relation is applicable to any
renormalizable fields with spin $\leq 1$, excluding gauge fields. In this
particular study, we investigate a rigidly rotating solution ($\Omega =
\text{const}$) at global equilibrium for massless fermionic matter. It has been
shown that the applicability of a hydrodynamic description requires a hierarchy
$\Omega R \gg \Omega \beta_{0}$, where $R$ is the radius of the
cylindrical-shaped rotating matter and $\beta_{0} = 1/T_{0}$ is the inverse
temperature on the rotation axis. Consequently, the thermodynamic free energy
$\Phi$ depends on the angular velocity through the product $\Omega R$, a
dependency that extends to other thermodynamic variables as well. These
findings are consistent with recent lattice QCD simulation results.
Furthermore, we compute the moment of inertia for massless fermions and
estimate the light quark contribution to the total moment of inertia of the
Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions.

  bubble in RCW79</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08976v2</link><description>  Recent spectroscopic observations of the [C II] 158$\,\mathrm{\mu m}$
fine-structure line of ionized carbon (C$^+$), using the Stratospheric
Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), have revealed expanding [C II]
shells in Galactic H\,{ II} regions. We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped
source (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H II region, excited by a
single O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble
is still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$. This indicates most likely a very early
evolutionary state, in which the stellar wind has not yet blown material away,
as it is the case for more evolved H II regions. Using the SimLine non-LTE
radiative transfer code, the [C II] emission can be modeled to originate from
three regions. First, a central H II region with little C$^+$ in the fully
ionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around
$2500\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer
is a slowly expanding [C II] shell with an expansion velocity of
$\sim\,$$2.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature
and velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in
the optically thick [C II] line ($\tau \sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit
in [C II] emission and a low ratio of [C II] to total far-infrared (FIR)
emission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C II] flux and
find a linear correlation between [C II] and FIR without a [C II]-deficit. This
demonstrates that at least some of the [C II]-deficit found in Galactic H II
bubbles can be attributed to self-absorption.

bound states in field space characterized by nonzero motion that breaks the
underlying time translation symmetry of its Hamiltonian, known as time
crystals. We demonstrate that an ideal fluid made up of these time crystals
behaves as phantom dark energy characterized by an equation of state $w \le
-1$, speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2} &gt; 0$, and nonnegative energy density
$\rho \ge 0$.

  TeV</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18291v1</link><description>  Studying heavy-flavor jets in pp collision is important since they can test
pQCD calculations and be used as a reference for heavy-ion collisions. Jets in
this analysis are reconstructed from charged particles using the
anti-$k_{\mathrm{T}}$ algorithm with a resolution parameter $R=$ 0.4 and with
pseudorapidity $|\eta|&lt;$ 0.5. Beauty jets are tagged using a machine learning
model that uses a convolutional neural network trained on information extracted
from the jet, tracks, and secondary vertices. The results show that this model
is superior compared to other traditional tagging methods.

  collisions using Machine Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18279v1</link><description>  Studies of heavy-quark (charm and beauty) production in hadronic and nuclear
collisions provide excellent testing grounds for the theory of strong
interaction, quantum chromodynamics. Heavy-quarks are produced predominantly in
the initial hard partonic interactions, allowing them to witness the entire
evolution process. The charm hadrons are produced in two ways. Firstly, the
prompt charm hadrons which are formed from the charm quark hadronization which
are produced directly from the initial hard-scatterings or the decay of other
excited charm states. Secondly, the nonprompt charm hadrons which are produced
from the decay of beauty hadrons. The produced charm hadrons then usually decay
to light-flavor hadrons or leptons via two or three body decay. The
reconstruction of charm hadrons is challenging due to the large combinatorial
background as well as the difficulty of distinguishing between prompt and
non-prompt charm hadrons. In this work, we use machine learning models--XGboost
and Deep Neural Network--to reconstruct $\Lambda_c^{+} (udc)$ hadrons via its
three body final state decay channel, $\Lambda_c^{+} \rightarrow pK^0_s$ and
$K^0_s \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$. Using several experimentally available
features of the decay daughters, these models can separate signal from
background and identify prompt and nonprompt candidates with nearly 99\%
accuracy. This method performs an unbinned track-level reconstruction since the
$\Lambda_c$ candidates are tagged directly from their decay daughters. The
necessary data for this study are simulated in pp collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=13.6$~TeV using PYTHIA8 (Monash) model.

topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase
transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and
condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing
first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in
systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as
second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence
of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase
transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second
order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects
in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be
predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.

  signal</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18263v1</link><description>  COSINUS is a dark matter direct detection experiment using NaI crystals as
cryogenic scintillating calorimeters. If no signal is observed, this will
constrain the dark matter scattering rate in sodium iodide. We investigate how
this constraint can be used to infer that the annual modulation signal observed
in DAMA/LIBRA experiment cannot originate from dark matter nuclear recoil
events, independent of the DM model. We achieve this by unfolding the DAMA
modulation spectrum to obtain the implied unquenched nuclear recoil spectrum,
which we compare to the expected COSINUS sensitivity. We find that assuming
zero background in the signal region, a 1$\sigma$, 2$\sigma$ or 3$\sigma$
confidence limit exclusion can be obtained with 57, 130 or 250 kg day of
exposure, respectively.

are real demonstrations of string junction role in the baryon charge transfer
at baryon production in HE proton-proton interactions. In order to invent the
neutral heavy particle with zero baryon charge as a candidate for Dark Matter,
it is necessary to turn back to the times of dual topological unitarization of
hadroproduction physics, where the pomeron exchanges play leading role with the
growing energies. The topological presentation of pomeron exchange at the HE
proton-proton collision is a cylinder that is covered with a quark-gluon net.
Taking into account that the junction of three gluons (SJ) has the positive
baryon number, as well as the antijunction (antiSJ) is of negative baryon
charge, the neutral self-connected baryonium configuration with zero baryon
charge is a torus that is covered by a discrete number of hexagons with 3
string junction and 3 antijunction vertices each. The possibilities to observ
such baryonium tori are discussed in this paper for three cases: collisions at
p-p collider, the cosmic particle collisions with the atmosphere, and in the
relativistic jets at the Active Galaxy Nuclei as well.

  meason under perturbation QCD</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18216v1</link><description>  In the perturbative QCD framework, we use the quasi-two-body method to study
the CP violations and branching ratios in the $\bar B_{s} \rightarrow
[\phi(\rho^{0},\omega)\rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}][K^{*0}\rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{-}]$
and $\bar B_{s} \rightarrow [\rho^{0}(\omega,\phi)\rightarrow
(\pi^{+}\pi^{-})][K^{*0}\rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{-}]$ decay processes. Owing to
the interference effects of $\rho^{0}$, $\omega$, and $\phi$, new strong phases
associated with vector mesons will be generated, resulting in relatively large
CP violation within the interference region. Moreover, we provide numerical
comparisons of CP violation from resonance effects and non-resonance
contributions. In order to provide better theoretical predictions for future
experiments, we integrate CP violation over invariant mass to obtain the
regional CP violation value. Furthermore, we have calculated the polarization
fractions and branching ratios for different intermediate states in the
four-body decay process, which may be influenced by vector interference
effects. Additionally, we discuss the possibility of observing the predicted CP
violation at the LHC.

19,fb$^{-1}$ collected by the BESIII detector at center-of-mass energies
ranging from 4.13 to 4.70,GeV, we report the first evidence for a new excited
$\Omega^{-}$ hyperon, the $\Omega(2109)^{-}$, through the process $e^+ e^- \to
\Omega(2109)^{-} \bar{\Omega}^{+} +c.c.$ with a significance of 4.1 $\sigma$.
The mass and width of $\Omega(2109)^{-}$ are measured to be $2108.5 \pm
5.2_{\rm stat} \pm 0.9_{\rm syst}\,{\rm MeV}/c^{2}$ and $18.3 \pm 16.4_{\rm

for a new production mechanism for the previously identified $\Omega(2012)^-$
via the process $e^+ e^- \to \Omega(2012)^{-} \bar{\Omega}^{+} +c.c.$ with a

in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method
makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial
volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the
Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume
effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that
the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the
three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.

models to include heavy fermion representations associated with
higher-dimensional decay operators. The latter have recently been shown to
self-consistently trigger a period of early matter domination, making the
underlying axion models cosmologically viable. After identifying all possible
representations up to decay operator dimension $d \leq 9$, we update the
hadronic axion band for the axion-photon coupling. The central regions of the
axion band are similar to those found previously and approximately independent
of the axion decay constant $f_a$, suggesting that they are robust predictions
and targets for future axion searches. Moreover, we find that $d = 6$ and $d =
7$ operators can lead to two new viable "model islands" around $f_a \sim
10^{12}$ GeV and $f_a \sim 10^{14}$ GeV, i.e., beyond the standard
post-inflationary mass region.

  IceCube-Gen2</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19338v2</link><description>  In this work, we investigate the impact of the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model, which
predicts a new massive gauge boson, $Z'$, on astrophysical neutrino events at
the IceCube Observatory. This new gauge boson couples with leptons from the
second and third families, and would break the power law of the astrophysical
neutrino flux due to the interaction of this flux with the cosmic neutrino
background. We derive the sensitivity of the IceCube to this model considering
the HESE data from 12 years of observation by assuming different assumptions
for the redshift distributions of astrophysical neutrino sources, mass
ordering, and sum of neutrino masses. Our results indicate that the current
IceCube data is able to probe small coupling and masses of the order of some
few MeV, with the covered parameter space being larger if a distribution of
neutrino sources is described by the star formation rate model. In addition, we
demonstrate that the IceCube-Gen2 will cover a large region of the parameter
space and will allow us to improve our understanding of the $L_\mu - L_\tau$
model.

interactions in the Higgs sector, specifically focusing on the process $\mu^-
\mu^+ \to h \bar{\nu_{l}} \nu_{l} \to b\bar{b} \bar{\nu_{l}}\nu_{l}$. Using a
model-independent approach within the framework of the Standard Model Effective
Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the contribution of dimension-six operators to
Higgs-gauge boson couplings, emphasizing CP-violating effects. To simulate the
process, all signal and background events are generated through MadGraph. The
analysis provides 95\% confidence level limits on the relevant Wilson
coefficients $\tilde{c}_{HB}$, $\tilde{c}_{HW}$, $\tilde{c}_{\gamma}$, with a
comparative discussion of existing experimental and phenomenological
constraints. Our best constraints on the $\tilde{c}_{HB}$, $\tilde{c}_{HW}$,
$\tilde{c}_{\gamma}$ with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$ are
$[-0.017428;0.018991]$, $[-0.002880;0.002586]$ and $[-0.010784;0.011381]$,
respectively. In this context, this study highlights the capability of future
muon collider experiments to probe new physics in the Higgs sector, potentially
offering tighter constraints on CP-violating Higgs-gauge boson interactions
than those provided by current colliders.

and three right-handed neutrinos. PQ symmetry allows the Dirac mass for
neutrinos and prevents the Majorana mass. A $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry guarantees
the stability of Dirac fermion dark matter. The breakdown of PQ symmetry
generates the QCD axion at a high scale. The fermion dark matter relic
abundance arises from the UV-freeze-in mechanism through the axion portal. We
determine the fermion DM relic by solving the coupled Boltzmann equations and
finding the allowed parameter space using the relic density constraints. Having
determined the allowed parameter space for fermion DM, we also look for
non-thermal axion production schemes to seek the two DM possibility. We find
that FIMP alone is a suitable dark matter that is not excluded while
considering several current bounds and future sensitivities on axion and dark
matter. Our study highlights the interlinking of dark matter, axion, and
neutrinos while addressing the strong CP problem and small neutrino masses.

the preheating dynamics after inflation. We show that a small feature in the
potential can enhance the resonance and bring the radiation-like state equation
during preheating despite the inflationary potential being a quadratic one.
Such localized features may naturally arise due to various physical effects
without altering the large-scale predictions of the original model for cosmic
microwave background (CMB) observables. We demonstrate that these features
effectively introduce localized higher-power terms in the potential,
significantly influencing the preheating dynamics $\unicode{x2013}$ a
phenomenon we term potential surge preheating. We outline the resulting
modifications in energy distribution among different components. We further
show that these small-scale features leave detectable imprints in the form of
gravitational wave signals. These signals influence CMB measurements of the
effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, offering a way to
reconstruct the shape of the inflaton potential at small scales. Finally, we
argue that these modifications to the scalar potential provide a framework to
explore preheating dynamics and the fragmentation of scalar fields using simple
scalar potentials.

model (ISM), inert triplet model (ITM), and inert doublet model (IDM) as beyond
Standard Model scenarios, and look into the running of the scalar quartic
couplings at one- and two-loop levels. Interestingly, the Landau poles at
one-loop and Fixed points at two-loop have been observed for these scenarios,
very similar to the $\phi^4$ theory, which is absent in the Standard Model. The
role of Higgs portal couplings in attaining these features has been examined.
For inert singlet and triplet models, the portal couplings give rise to terms
without any residual phases, enhancing this Fixed point behaviour. In the case
of the inert doublet model, $\lambda_{4,5}$ terms which have the residual
phases, spoil this behaviour. Finally, we consider perturbative unitarity
constraints to put limits on the scalar quartic couplings for various
perturbativity scales in both one- and two-loop. Larger portal couplings, i.e.
$\gsim 2$, get strong perturbative bounds as low as $10^{2-3}$ GeV.

  equipartition or swap</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09260v2</link><description>  Quantum kinetics of neutrinos are known to potentially change the classical
neutrino radiation field in high-energy astrophysical sources such as
core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. However, the mixing
phenomena still have open issues in the nonlinear dynamics and the asymptotic
states, particularly for recently discovered collision-induced flavor
conversion. In this paper, we investigate linear and nonlinear dynamics of
collisional neutrino-flavor conversion (CFC) with multi-energy neutrino gases
through numerical simulations, demonstrating that the asymptotic states
dramatically change depending on unstable modes dominating the system. In one
unstable mode, high-energy neutrinos reach a flavor equipartition, but
low-energy neutrinos return back to almost their initial states. In contrast,
in the other one, rather low-energy neutrinos achieve a full flavor swap, but
high-energy neutrinos undergo less flavor conversion. We clarify the distinct
spectral behaviors in two different ways based on stability analysis and flavor
pendulum. Our result suggests that CFC with flavor swap can become crucial at
deeper radii with low electron fraction and requires more detailed theoretical
modeling of neutrino quantum kinetics.

  $U(1)_X$ from colliders</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11820v3</link><description>  The origin of tiny neutrino mass is a long standing unsolved puzzle of the
Standard Model (SM), which allows us to consider scenarios beyond the Standard
Model (BSM) in a variety of ways. One of them being a gauge extension of the SM
may be realized as in the form of an anomaly free, general $U(1)_X$ extension
of the SM, where an $SU(2)_L$ triplet scalar with a $U(1)_X$ charge is
introduced to have Dirac Yukawa couplings with the SM lepton doublets. Once the
triplet scalar developes a Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV), light neutrinos
acquire their tiny Majorana masses. Hence, the decay modes of the triplet
scalar has a direct connection to the neutrino oscillation data for different
neutrino mass hierarchies. After the breaking of the $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, a
neutral $U(1)_X$ gauge boson $(Z^\prime)$ acquires mass, which interacts
differently with the left and right handed SM fermions. Satisfying the recent
LHC bounds on the triplet scalar and $Z^\prime$ boson productions, we study the
pair production of the triplet scalar at LHC, 100 TeV proton proton collider
FCC, $e^-e^+$ and $\mu^-\mu^+$ colliders followed by its decay into dominant
dilepton modes whose flavor structure depend on the neutrino mass hierarchy.
Generating the SM backgrounds, we study the possible signal significance of
four lepton final states from the triplet scalar pair production. We also
compare our results with the purely SM gauge mediated triplet scalar pair

tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the
background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator
$\mathcal{O}$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop
a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in
arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation
and the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow
equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed
forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results.
As several applications of the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$
deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational
models. Besides, we also deform the Lagrangians for scalar field theories.

early universe, and thereby trigger an early matter dominated era. Such
non-standard cosmological histories are expected to have profound effects on
the evolution and production of axion cold dark matter and dark radiation, as
well as their prospects for detection. We consider moduli-axion couplings and
investigate the early history of the coupled system, considering closely the
evolution of the homogeneous modulus field, the back-reaction from the axion,
and the energy densities of the two fields. A particular point of interest is
the enhancement of axion production from modulus decay, due to tachyonic and
parametric resonant instabilities, and the implications of such production on
the cosmological moduli problem, axion dark radiation, and the available
parameter space for axion dark matter. Using an effective field theory
approach, WKB-based semi-analytical analysis, and detailed numerical estimates
of the co-evolution of the system, we evaluate the expected decay efficiency of
the modulus to axions. The effects of higher-order operators are studied and
implications for UV-complete frameworks such as the Large Volume Scenarios in
Type IIB string theory are considered in detail.

candidate. Two right-handed neutrinos are assumed to have dominant off-diagonal
masses suggesting resonant leptogenesis as the origin of baryon asymmetry of
the Universe. Explicit higher dimensional lepton number violating operators,
are shown to play a crucial role in simultaneously controlling both the Majoron

relevant for resonant leptogenesis. We perform a combined analysis of Majoron
dark matter and leptogenesis, discussing the relative importance of self energy
and vertex contributions to CP asymmetry, and explore the parameter space,
leading to an intricate relation between neutrino mass, dark matter and baryon

$\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed
space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the
generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed
Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and
coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, derive the $\kappa$-deformed
homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We also obtain expression for the
$\kappa$-deformed gauge covariant derivative, valid up to first order in the
deformation parameter $a$. We show the compatibility between the
$\kappa$-deformed field strength derived using Jacobi identity and the
commutators of gauge covariant derivative, up to first order in $a$. The
$\kappa$-deformed field strength is covariant under $SU(N)$ gauge
transformations as the $a$-dependent corrections come with overall
multiplicative factors only, that is $\hat{F}^a_{0i} =F^a_{0i}
(1-\frac{ap_0}{\hbar})$ and $\hat{F}^a_{ij} = F^a_{ij}
(1-\frac{2ap_0}{\hbar})$, where $F^{a}_{\mu \nu}$ is the field strength in the
commutative space-time. We found that the $a$-dependent term in the deformed
Wong's equation does not contribute to the modification of Yang-Mills equation,
up to first order in $a$. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills
theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under
$SU(N)$ transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced
by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the
$\kappa$-space-time.

quarks, remain a central topic in particle physics due to the nonperturbative
nature of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at low energies. Heavy-quark symmetry
(HQS) provides a valuable framework for understanding the behavior of heavy
quarks in hadronic systems, offering insights into spin and flavor symmetries.
However, discrepancies between HQS predictions and experimental observations --
particularly the absence of predicted $B^{(*)}K$ molecular states, which should
be the bottom counterparts of the observed $D^{(*)}K$ molecular states --
challenge its universality. This study investigates the production of the
$\bar{B}_{s0}^{*}(5725)$ and $\bar{B}_{s1}^{*}(5778)$ states, the antiparticles
of the $B_{s0}^{*}(5725)$ and $B_{s1}^{*}(5778)$ states, interpreted as
molecular states containing $B\bar{K}$ and $B^{*}\bar{K}$ components, through
the reactions $K^{-}p \to \Lambda_{b}^{0}\bar{B}_{s0}^{*}$ and $K^{-}p \to
\Lambda_{b}^{0}\bar{B}_{s1}^{*}$. Using effective Lagrangians, we analyze the
cross sections, incorporating $t$-channel $B^{(*)}$ meson exchanges and
initial-state $\bar{K}N$ interactions (ISI). Our results reveal significant ISI
enhancements and energy-dependent production thresholds, with
$\bar{B}_{s0}^{*}(5725)$ exhibiting higher cross sections than
$\bar{B}_{s1}^{*}(5778)$. We suggest that the $\bar{B}_{s0}^{*}(5725)$ state
can be optimally searched for at beam energies around $12.91~\text{GeV}$, while
the $\bar{B}_{s1}^{*}(5778)$ state requires significantly higher energies for
its production. These findings provide valuable guidance for experimental
searches at facilities like CERN and J-PARC, offering a pathway to test HQS and
explore the nature of exotic hadrons. Theoretical uncertainties and

are also discussed.

(HQET) plays a crucial role in the analysis of inclusive $B$ decays, and
constitutes one of the dominant uncertainties in the determination of CKM
matrix element $|V_{ub}|$. On the other hand, the conventional heavy meson
shape function defined in QCD is also phenomenologically important and includes
shortdistance physics at energy scales of the heavy quark mass. In this work,
we derived a factorization formula relating these two kinds of shape functions,
which can be invoked to fully disentangle the effects from disparate scales
$m_b$ and $\Lambda_{\textrm{QCD}}$, particularly to facilitate the resummation
of logarithms $\ln m_b/\Lambda_{\textrm{QCD}}$. In addition, this factorization
constitutes an essential component of the recently developed two-step
factorization scheme, enabling lattice QCD calculations of lightcone quantities
of heavy meson. The results presented here pave the way for first-principles
nonperturbative predictions of shape function in the near future.

effects of astrophysical compact objects with next-generation gravitational
wave detectors, including the ground-based Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein
Telescope (ET), as well as the space-based Laser Interferomet Space Antenna
(LISA). Exploiting the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism, we
first characterize three types of quadrupole finite-size effects: the
spin-induced quadrupole moments, the conservative tidal deformations, and the
tidal heating. We then derive the corresponding contributions to the
gravitational waveform phases for binary compact objects in aligned-spin
quasi-circular orbits. We separately estimate the constraints on these
finite-size effects for black holes using the power spectral densities (PSDs)
of the CE+ET detector network and LISA observations. For the CE+ET network, we
find that the bounds on the mass-weighted spin-independent dissipation number
$H_0$ are of the order $O(1)$, while the bounds on the mass-weighted tidal Love
number $\tilde{\Lambda}$ are of the order $O(10)$. For high-spin binary black
holes with dimensionless spin $\chi \simeq 0.8$, the bounds on the symmetric
spin-induced quadrupole moment $\kappa_s$ are of the order $O(10^{-1})$. LISA
observations of supermassive black hole mergers offer slightly tighter
constraints on all three finite-size parameters. Additionally, we perform a
Fisher analysis for a binary neutron star merger within the CE+ET network. The
bounds on the tidal parameter $H_0$ and on $\tilde \Lambda$ are around two
orders of magnitude better than the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) bounds.

owing to the exceedingly heavy mass of the top quark, the mass splitting

internal structure of protons and neutrons, providing critical insights into
the non-perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). While the charge
radius is often interpreted as the ``size" of the nucleon, this interpretation
is an oversimplification that overlooks the multifaceted nature of nucleon
structure. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the different
nucleon radii, including the charge and magnetic radii, the axial radius, and
the emerging concepts of mechanical and mass radii. We discuss the definitions
as well as the experimental, theoretical and phenomenological determinations of
these radii, highlighting their distinct physical origins and implications. By
synthesizing recent experimental results and theoretical advancements, we
emphasize that each radius reflects a specific aspect of the nucleon's internal
structure, such as its electric charge distribution, magnetic properties, weak
interactions, or internal mechanical stress. In particular, we address the
common but misleading interpretation of the proton radius as a simple measure
of its size, underscoring the nuanced and context-dependent nature of nucleon
radii. Through this exploration, we aim to clarify the roles of these radii in
characterizing nucleon structure and to identify open questions that remain to
be addressed. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the nucleon
and its significance in the broader context of particle and nuclear physics.

containing scalar triplets at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been
identified as germane, and subjected to a detailed study. The scalar spectrum
of the model, which imposes a custodial SU(2) on the potential, gets classified
into a 5-plet, a 3-plet and two singlets under the custodial symmetry. While
most attempts to probe or constrain the scenario at the LHC depend largely on
signals of charged scalars, we point out that the custodial SU(2) singlet state
H can have a substantial branching ratio (amounting to a few percent) into two
photons. We carry out a detailed simulation of the resulting signal and the
standard model backgrounds, obtaining the signal significance in different
regions of the parameter space using the profile likelihood ratio method.
Substantial regions of the GM parameter space is thus shown to be accessible to
LHC studies, both at the high-luminosity run with $\int {\cal L} dt = 3000
fb^{-1}$, and also in Run-3 with $\int {\cal L} dt = 300 fb^{-1}$, even after
folding in systematic errors. We have also demonstrated that a rather
subtantial improvement in the signal significance is achieved by switching over
from a cut-based analysis to one based on neural network.

generic heavy sector decoupled from the Standard Model. The sole and
unavoidable exception to this decoupling arises from gravitational
interactions. We demonstrate that gravity can couple the Higgs to the heavy
scale significantly earlier than the well-known three-loop top-quark-mediated

finite naturalness disfavors large-field inflationary models involving
super-Planckian field excursions. In contrast, in the small-field regime,
achieving successful inflation requires substantial fine-tuning of the initial
conditions, in agreement with previous results. Recent data from the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope further amplify the tension between naturalness and
fine-tuning, challenging the theoretical robustness of single-field inflation
as a compelling explanation for the origin of the universe.

making accurate predictions of the baryon asymmetry and gravitational wave (GW)

thermal equilibrium approximation, we exploit entropy conservation to present
efficient algorithms for computing $v_w$, significantly streamlining the

two sample models capable of enabling a strong first-order electroweak phase
transition: a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric singlet extension of the SM, and a model
for baryogenesis with CP violation in the dark sector. We study correlations
among $v_w$ and the two common measures of phase transition strength,
$\alpha_n$ and $v_n/T_n$. Interestingly, we find a relatively model-insensitive
relationship between $v_n/T_n$ and $\alpha_n$. We also observe an upper bound
on $\alpha_n$ for the deflagration/hybrid wall profiles naturally compatible
with EWBG, the exact value for which varies between models, significantly
impacting the strength of the GW signals. In summary, our work provides a
framework for exploring the feasibility of EWBG models in light of future GW

  Weak to Strong Backreaction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750v1</link><description>  We consider, in the context of axion-inflation, the \textit{Pure Natural
Inflation} (PNI) model coupled with an SU(2) gauge sector via a Chern-Simons
term. As the axion rolls down its potential, it dissipates energy in the gauge
sector thus sourcing fluctuations of scalar and tensor degrees of freedom
therein. Gauge field fluctuations will, in turn, feed primordial gravitational
waves as well as curvature perturbations. Remarkably, we can use upcoming
cosmological probes to test this mechanism across a vast range of scales, from
the CMB to laser interferometers. Due to their flat plateau at large field
values, we find that PNI potentials fare better vis-\'{a}-vis CMB observations
than the conventional sinusoidal potential of chromo-natural inflation (CNI).
We show that, even when the dynamics begin in the weak backreaction regime, the
rolling of the axion leads to a build-up of the gauge-quanta production,
invariably triggering the strong backreaction of the gauge sector tensors on
the background dynamics. This transition results in the copious production of
both scalar and tensor perturbations, which we study in detail. The
gravitational wave signatures include a rich peak structure with a
characteristic scale-dependent chirality, a compelling target for future
gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the peak in scalar perturbations
may lead to the formation of primordial black holes, potentially accounting for
a significant fraction of the observed dark matter abundance.

multi-messenger observations for binary neutron star merger events can exert
great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. Extending the previous

cosmological parameter estimation by considering their associated
electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, including $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB)
coincidence observations by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic
Counterpart All-sky Monitor and GW-triggered target-of-opportunity observations
of kilonovae by different optical survey projects. During an assumed 10-year
observation, we predict that the number of detectable GW-kilonova events is
$\sim 4900$ with redshifts below $\sim 0.4$ under GW network and Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope in the $i$ band, which is three times more than that of GW-GRB
detections. For the cosmological analysis, we find that with the inclusion of
GW-kilonova detections, the constraints on cosmological parameters from GW-EM
detections are significantly improved compared to those from GW-GRB detections.
In particular, GW-EM detections can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with
a precision ranging from $0.076\%$ to $0.034\%$. Moreover, GW multi-messenger
observations could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies
generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). The combination
of CBS and GW-EM can tightly constrain the equation of state parameters of dark
energy $w$ in the $w$CDM model and $w_0$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model with
precisions of $0.72\%$ and $0.99\%$, respectively, meeting the standard of
precision cosmology. In conclusion, GW multi-messenger observations could play
a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probing the fundamental
nature of dark energy.

consider a neutrinophilic two-Higgs doublet model ($\nu$2HDM), which consists
of one extra Higgs doublet and a light right-handed neutrino. This model is
extended with a light ($\sim 10$~MeV) singlet scalar DM $\phi_3$, which is
stabilized under an extra dark $Z_2^{\rm DM}$ symmetry and can only effectively
annihilate through the CP even scalar $H$. Although oblique parameters put
tight constraints on the model, introduction of vectorlike leptons (VLL) can
potentially salvage the issue. The vectorlike doublet $N$ and singlet $\chi$
are also stabilized through dark $Z_2^{\rm DM}$ symmetry. The lightest
vectorlike mass eigenstate ($\chi_1 \sim 100$~GeV) is the 2nd DM component of
the model. The fermion DM is restricted in a narrow mass region while a
somewhat broader mass region is allowed for the scalar DM. However, when two DM
sectors are coupled, the annihilation channel $\chi_1 \chi_1 \to \phi_3 \phi_3$
opens up. As a result, the fermionic relic density decreases, and paves way for
broader fermionic DM mass region with under-abundant relic: a region of
$[30-65]$ GeV compared to a narrower $[40-50]$ GeV window for the single
component case. On the other hand, the light DM $\phi_3$ acquires significant
boost from the annihilation of $\chi_1$, causing a dilution in the resonant
annihilation of $\phi_3$. This in turn increases the scalar DM relic, allowing
for a smaller mass region compared to the individual case. The exact and
underabundant relic is achievable in a significant parameter space of the
two-component model where the total DM relic is mainly dominated by the
fermionic DM contribution. The scalar DM is found to be sub-dominant or equally
dominant ($\sim 30 \% - 80 \%$ of total DM) with significant boost which can be
detected in experiments.
